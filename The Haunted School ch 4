Chapter 4: Old Tom’s Music Box
 The classroom where Mr. Grayson’s ghostly students had faded still hummed with an unnatural quiet, the chalkboard now blank and the desks still. Emma’s pulse hadn’t slowed, her mind replaying Lucas’s surprising moment of bravery teaching the lesson. The new door that appeared in the wall glowed faintly, its carved frame etched with gears and tools, unlike the ivy patterns of before. Ms. Harper’s flashlight flickered, her face pale but determined. “We’re making progress,” she said, though her voice held a question, as if daring the school to prove her wrong. Aisha, clutching her sketchbook, whispered, “It’s not over yet. I feel… regret, deep down.”Mia, her notebook open, jotted down details about Mr. Grayson’s task. “Three ghosts left, if Clara was right. What’s next?” Lucas, buoyed by his success, shrugged. “Hope it’s not another history test.” But Noah, still jumpy, gripped his useless laptop. “Guys, did you hear that?” A faint clinking, like metal on stone, echoed from beyond the door, followed by a low, mournful hum.Emma pushed the door open, revealing a narrow staircase spiraling downward. The air grew damp, smelling of rust and earth, and the walls were lined with chipped bricks, lit by flickering oil lamps. “The basement,” Noah groaned. “Of course it’s the basement. Every horror movie ever.” Lucas nudged him. “Man up, tech guy. We’ve got this.” But his grin wavered as the clinking grew louder.The stairs creaked under their sneakers, and at the bottom sprawled a cavernous room cluttered with old crates, rusted pipes, and dusty tools. A workbench stood in the center, littered with screws and gears. The oil lamps cast long shadows, making the pipes seem to twist like veins. Aisha pointed to a corner, where a faint glow pulsed. “There!” she said, her voice soft but urgent.The glow formed into a burly man in worn overalls, his face weathered, with a gray beard and sad eyes. He held a wrench, but it passed through his hand, clattering to the floor. “I’m Tom,” he said, his voice rough like gravel. “Janitor here in 1890. I promised little Ellie I’d fix her music box, but I never did. It’s my shame, keepin’ me here.”Emma’s heart ached for him. “Where’s the music box, Tom? We’ll help.” He pointed to the workbench, where a small, tarnished box sat, its lid engraved with stars. “It’s broken,” he said. “Needs a new gear and a steady hand. But the school… it don’t want me free.” The shadows shifted, and tools rattled on their hooks.Noah, despite his nerves, stepped forward. “I’m good with tech. I can fix it.” Mia raised an eyebrow. “A music box isn’t a computer, Noah.” He blushed but grabbed a screwdriver. “Same idea—parts working together.” Ms. Harper nodded, her flashlight steadying. “Careful, Noah. We’re with you.”As Noah opened the box, a faint, broken tune plinked, then stopped. Inside, gears were rusted, one missing entirely. “I need a replacement,” he said, scanning the workbench. But as he reached for a pile of gears, a wrench flew off the wall, narrowly missing his head. Aisha gasped, and Lucas shouted, “What was that?” The shadows thickened, forming vague shapes that whispered, “Stay… stay…”“It’s the school,” Tom growled. “It don’t like change.” Pipes groaned, and a hammer skidded across the floor. Emma grabbed Noah’s arm. “Keep going! We’ll watch your back.” Mia and Aisha shoved crates to block flying tools, while Lucas swatted at a rogue screwdriver with his jacket. Ms. Harper’s flashlight dimmed, but she held it high, shouting, “Stay focused!”Noah’s hands shook as he sorted gears, sweat beading on his forehead. “This one might fit,” he said, holding a small, shiny gear. The whispers grew louder, and a cold hand brushed Emma’s neck, making her shudder. “Hurry, Noah!” she urged. He slotted the gear, twisting it into place, and wound the box’s key. The room stilled, the shadows retreating.A soft lullaby filled the air, clear and sweet, like a child’s laugh. Tom’s glow brightened, his sad eyes softening. “That’s Ellie’s song,” he said, a tear vanishing into his beard. “You’ve done it, lad. I’m free.” He reached out, as if to pat Noah’s shoulder, but his hand dissolved. “Thank you all.” His form faded, and the music box’s tune lingered, then stopped.The oil lamps flared, revealing a new staircase leading up. Noah exhaled, clutching the screwdriver like a trophy. “I did it,” he said, grinning. Lucas clapped his back. “Not bad, tech guy.” Aisha smiled, sketching the music box in her book. “Ellie’s happy now. I can feel it.”Ms. Harper’s flashlight steadied, but her eyes were wary. “We’re not done yet.” As they climbed the stairs, a faint brushstroke sound echoed from above, like paint on canvas. Emma’s stomach twisted. Another ghost was waiting, and the school’s shadows seemed to watch their every step.
