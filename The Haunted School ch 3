Chapter 3: Mr. Grayson’s Lesson

The library’s air still buzzed with the echo of Clara’s farewell, but the glowing footprints that had led them to her diary were gone. Emma clutched the leather-bound book, its faint warmth a reminder their night in Willow Creek Middle School was far from over. The storm outside roared, rattling the warped windows, and the gas lanterns flickered, casting jittery shadows across the ancient bookshelves. Lucas, trying to shake off his unease, nudged Noah. “So, what’s next? Another ghost with a lost homework assignment?” His grin faltered when a deep, gravelly voice rumbled from the hallway: “My lesson… it must be finished.”Ms. Harper’s flashlight beam darted toward the sound, illuminating a doorway that hadn’t been there moments ago. The frame was carved with ivy patterns, and beyond it stretched a corridor lined with cracked plaster walls and flickering sconces. “Stay together,” she said, her voice steadying despite the fear in her eyes. Aisha shivered, clutching her sketchbook. “It’s so sad here, like someone’s waiting.” Mia adjusted her glasses, her curiosity sparked. “Clara said there were five ghosts. This must be the next one.”Emma led the way, her sneakers creaking on the warped floorboards. The corridor ended at a classroom, its door ajar, revealing rows of wooden desks etched with old initials. A massive chalkboard dominated the front, covered in faded equations and maps. The air smelled of chalk dust and mildew, and a cold draft swirled, making Noah’s teeth chatter. “This place gives me the creeps,” he muttered, hugging his dead laptop.As they stepped inside, the desks rattled, sliding an inch toward them. Mia yelped, and Lucas jumped back, his bravado cracking. “Okay, that’s not normal!” Before anyone could respond, a figure materialized at the front of the room—a tall man in a tweed suit, his gray hair slicked back, holding a wooden pointer. His eyes were hollow, but his voice carried weight. “I am Mr. Grayson, history teacher of 1882. My final lesson was never taught. I cannot rest until it is complete.”Emma’s heart pounded, but she stepped forward. “What do we need to do, Mr. Grayson?”He pointed to a cluttered desk piled with yellowed papers. “My lesson plan—on the founding of Willow Creek—lies there, but it’s incomplete. Decipher it, teach it, and my students will hear me at last.” His form flickered, and the chalkboard squeaked, writing: Time runs short. Shadows pulsed in the corners, as if the school itself were impatient.Mia, drawn to the challenge, rushed to the desk, sifting through brittle papers. “These are coded!” she said, her voice a mix of fear and excitement. The notes were scribbled in strange symbols, like a mix of letters and shapes. Noah peered over her shoulder. “Maybe it’s a cipher. I’ve seen these on math apps.” Lucas rolled his eyes. “Great, a ghost pop quiz. Just what I needed.”“Focus, Lucas,” Ms. Harper urged, her flashlight dimming. Aisha noticed carvings on the desks—names like “Elijah 1879”—and whispered, “These were real kids, like us. They’re the students he’s talking about.” Her words steadied the group, and they huddled around Mia.Mia’s pencil flew as she cracked the code, revealing a lesson about Willow Creek’s founding: a story of settlers, a mill, and a fire that united the town. “But it ends mid-sentence,” she said. “We’ve got to finish it.” The desks rattled again, and chalk dust swirled, forming ghostly shapes in the air. Emma glanced at Lucas, who’d been quiet. “You’re good at history, Lucas. Can you teach it?”“Me?” he asked scoffed, his skepticism flaring. “I’m not a nerd like you guys.” But Aisha’s encouraging nod pushed him forward. “You’ve got this, Lucas. Just tell the story.”Taking a deep breath, Lucas stood at the chalkboard, his voice shaky at first. “So…So… Willow Creek started with people building a mill by the river. A fire burned it down, but they rebuilt it together. It’s why the town’s here today.” As he spoke, the ghostly figures of students appeared in the desks, their faces softening. Mr. Grayson’s hollow eyes gleamed with pride. “Well done,” he said. “My lesson is heard.” His form glowed, then faded, leaving a faint warmth in the room.The chalkboard erased itself, and the desks stilled. A new door appeared in the wall, glowing softly. Ms. Harper exhaled, her relief palpable. “You did it, Lucas,” she said, her voice filled with pride. Lucas shrugged, but his grin was genuine. “Yeah, well, maybe history’s not so bad.”But as they moved toward the door, a low moan echoed from deeper in the school, and the sconces flickered. Noah gripped Emma’s arm. “That’s not Mr. Grayson.” The shadows whispered, and Emma knew another ghost was calling.
