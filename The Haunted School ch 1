Chapter 1: The Storm’s Grip
 
The library of Willow Creek Middle School buzzed with the chaotic energy of five students racing to finish their science project before the weekend. Emma Thompson, her dark ponytail swinging, leaned over a papier-mâché volcano, carefully gluing red tissue paper to mimic lava. She was the group’s unofficial leader, always stepping up, though a knot of worry tightened in her chest—she couldn’t let her friends down, not like she sometimes felt she did with her little sister at home. “Come on, guys, we need this done by six,” she said, glancing at the clock.Lucas Rivera, slouched in a chair, tossed a pencil in the air, catching it with a grin. “Chill, Emma. It’s just a volcano. We’ve got this.” His jokes hid the sting of being labeled the class clown, always expected to laugh off pressure. Next to him, Mia Chen scribbled notes in her notebook, her glasses slipping down her nose. She loved books more than people sometimes, but doubted her ideas were good enough to share. “The baking soda ratio has to be perfect,” she muttered, double-checking her calculations.Noah Patel, hunched over his laptop, tapped frantically, trying to sync a video of an erupting volcano for their presentation. His gadgets were his shield against the world, but his fingers shook slightly—he hated being unprepared. “If this crashes again, I’m done,” he groaned. Aisha Khan, sketching a poster for the project, hummed softly, her colored pencils dancing across the paper. She noticed everyone’s tension, her kind heart picking up on feelings others missed. “It’s looking great, Noah,” she said, offering a warm smile.Ms. Harper, their science teacher, stood by the library door, checking her watch. Her calm demeanor usually steadied the group, but her brow furrowed as thunder rumbled outside. “Let’s wrap up soon, everyone. The forecast didn’t mention a storm.” Her voice wavered, betraying her concern for getting the kids home safely.A sudden gust rattled the windows, and the sky darkened, turning the late afternoon into night. Rain lashed the glass, and a crack of lightning illuminated the library, casting eerie shadows across the bookshelves. The lights flickered, then died, plunging the room into darkness. Mia gasped, and Noah’s laptop screen blinked out. “Seriously?” Lucas said, his voice less cocky now. Emma fumbled for her phone’s flashlight, its beam slicing through the gloom.“Stay calm,” Ms. Harper said, pulling a flashlight from her bag. “It’s just a power outage.” But as she spoke, the library changed. The colorful posters of planets and scientists vanished, replaced by faded oil paintings of stern-faced people in old-fashioned clothes. The modern carpet morphed into worn wooden floorboards, creaking under their feet. Cobwebs draped the corners, and the air grew cold, smelling of damp wood and old ink.“What’s happening?” Noah whispered, his voice barely audible over the storm. Aisha hugged her sketchbook, her eyes wide. “It feels… wrong in here.”Emma’s flashlight swept across a chalkboard near the librarian’s desk. Chalk scratched across it, writing in loopy cursive: You cannot leave. The group froze, their breaths visible in the chilly air. Lucas forced a laugh. “Okay, who’s pranking us? Noah, is this your tech?” Noah shook his head, his face pale.Ms. Harper stepped toward the door, jiggling the handle. It didn’t budge. “It’s locked,” she said, her voice tight. She tried the windows, but they were sealed, the glass unnaturally cold. Thunder boomed, shaking the walls, and the bookshelves groaned, as if the room itself were alive.Mia, clutching her notebook, noticed something on a nearby table—a brass gas lantern, glowing faintly, though no one had lit it. “This wasn’t here before,” she said, her curiosity overriding her fear. As she touched it, the flame flared, casting light on a portrait above the table. The painted eyes of a woman in a high-collared dress seemed to follow them.“Guys, look!” Aisha pointed to the floor, where faint, glowing footprints appeared, leading toward the back of the library. They weren’t sneaker prints—they were small, like old-fashioned boots. Emma’s heart pounded, but she squared her shoulders. “We need to figure this out. Together.”Lucas crossed his arms, trying to hide his unease. “Or we could just wait for the janitor. Right?” But a low, mournful wail echoed from the hallway, and the glowing footprints pulsed brighter. Ms. Harper gripped her flashlight, her teacherly calm cracking. “Stay close, everyone. Something’s not right.”Emma took a deep breath, her fear of failing her friends pushing her forward. “Let’s follow the footprints. Maybe they’ll lead us to answers.” As the group moved, the storm roared louder, and the library’s shadows seemed to whisper, watching their every step. Willow Creek Middle School was no longer their school—and they were no longer alone.
